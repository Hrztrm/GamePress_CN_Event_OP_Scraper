# GamePress_CN_Event_OP_Scraper
This will use the link "https://gamepress.gg/arknights/other/cn-event-and-campaign-list" and find the value of OP that will be received from the event from event stage clears. If event has no OP, it will show it has no OP. 

I did it python and converted it into an exe file in the "dist" folder using "pyinstaller".
